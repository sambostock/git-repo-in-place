# Self Cloning Repo

This repo is an experiment in self-cloning. The expected usage is:

- Download this repo as a regular directory without using git (e.g. tar or zip form GitHub)
- Run a script within the directory
- The script should replace the directory in-place with the contents it would have as if it had been git cloned
